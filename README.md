# RsCodeDump

Welcome to **RsCodeDump**, a personal repository designed to organize, showcase, and experiment with various projects. This repo contains everything from network programming and mini games to studies of Rust fundamentals and exercises from the official book.

## Contents

1. **[Network Programming](https://github.com/0xSickb0y/RsCodeDump/tree/main/rustnet)**  
   This section contains implementations and tests of network functionalities in **Rust**. Here, I experiment with building networked applications, socket programming, and handling communication protocols.

2. **[Rust Book Studies](https://github.com/0xSickb0y/RsCodeDump/tree/main/studies)**  
   Code and exercises derived from studying *The Rust Programming Language* book ([The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)). If you're learning Rust or want to review key concepts, this is a great place to check out my implementation of the book's examples and challenges.

3. **[Rustlings Exercises](https://github.com/0xSickb0y/RsCodeDump/tree/main/rustlings)**  
   My personal solutions to the [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) exercises, which are designed to help newcomers practice Rust syntax and concepts in a hands-on way.

4. **[Mini Games](https://github.com/0xSickb0y/RsCodeDump/tree/main/games)**  
   A collection of **mini games** built using Rust. These games are simple terminal-based projects, they demonstrate basic Rust features, including game logic and user input handling, but aren't complex by any means.
