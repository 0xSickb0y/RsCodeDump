# Generic Data Types

We use generics to create definitions for items like function signatures or structs, which we can then use with many different concrete data types.

Generics allow you to define code that works with multiple types by parameterizing the type(s) it operates on. This makes your code more modular and reusable, as you don't need to write separate implementations for each type you might use.

## Using Generics in Functions, Structs, and Enums

Generics in Rust enable you to write flexible, reusable code that works with multiple data types without duplication. __Functions__ can take generic type parameters, allowing them to handle different types, such as finding the largest element in a list of integers or characters.

By applying __trait bounds__, you can restrict the types to only those that implement specific behaviors (like comparison), ensuring type safety while maintaining versatility. 

This same flexibility extends to __structs__, where you can define data types like `Point<T>` to store values of any type, such as integers or floats, without needing separate structs for each type. If you need different types for different fields, you can use multiple generic parameters, offering even greater flexibility.

In __enums__, generics help create reusable types that can represent values of any type. The `Option<T>` enum from the standard library, for example, can be used to represent either a value of type T or no value at all, adapting easily to various contexts. 

## Performance of Generics

A common concern when using generics is whether it introduces runtime overhead. The great news is that generics in Rust do not incur runtime cost. This is because Rust performs a process called monomorphization at compile time.

Monomorphization is the process of replacing generic code with specific implementations for each type used. This means that when you use a generic function or struct, the compiler generates separate code for each concrete type used. The result is that your program performs just as it would if you manually wrote specific code for each type, without any runtime penalty.

For example, if you use `Option<i32>` and `Option<f64>`, the compiler will generate separate versions of `Option<T>` for i32 and f64, effectively removing the generic abstraction at runtime.


## Conclusion

Generics in Rust enable highly reusable, type-safe code. With the ability to define functions, structs, enums, and methods that work across many types, generics reduce duplication and improve maintainability. Combined with trait bounds, generics allow you to express complex behavior while ensuring that only valid types are used. Moreover, Rust's monomorphization ensures that generics come with no performance overhead.
