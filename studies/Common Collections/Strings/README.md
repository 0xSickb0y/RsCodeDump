# Storing UTF-8 Encoded Text with Strings

We discuss strings in the context of collections because strings are implemented as a collection of bytes, plus some methods provide useful functionallity when those bytes are interpreted as text.

In this section we'll talk about the operations on `String` that every collection type has, such as creating, updating, and reading. We'll also discuss the ways in which `string` is different from the other collections, namely how indexing into a `String` is complicated by the differences between how people and computers interpret `String` data.
