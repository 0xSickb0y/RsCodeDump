# Using Structs to Structure Related Data

A struct, or structure, is a custom data type that lets you package together and name multiple related values that make up a meaningful group.
If you’re familiar with an object-oriented language, a struct is like an object’s data attributes.

Structs are similar to tuples, in that both hold multiple related values.
Like tuples, the pieces of a struct can be different types. Unlike with tuples, in a struct you’ll name each piece of data so it’s clear what the values mean.
Adding these names means that structs are more flexible than tuples: you don’t have to rely on the order of the data to specify or access the values of an instance.
